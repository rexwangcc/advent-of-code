This is my attempt on [Advent Of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) problems.

I was not expecting I will have time to finish all of the problems, so don't be surprised 
to find only a few solutions. I also did not try to find the optimal solution for each
problem.

Solution code is written in Python for the first iteration, will try Golang, Rust later
only if I have time...
